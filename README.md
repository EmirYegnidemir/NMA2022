Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Angry Tweets Prediction 

This project was completed during a 3-week course in Neuromatch Academy (NMA), and was our first project applying the skills we learned during the course. While we were able to successfully apply some of the concepts we learned, we faced some hardware limitations that prevented us from achieving the results we were hoping for.
This project was done by Yashaswi Pupenja, Emir YeÄŸnidemir, MohammadJavad Salehi, Maryam Mahdavimoghadam, Muskaan Vermathe and the mentor of the project was Asst. Prof. Ulya Bayram.
